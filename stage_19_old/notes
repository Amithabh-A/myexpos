Importanat Note: 

* eXpOS requires that the index of the inode table entry 
of a file and the index of its root file entry must match. 
For example, suppose the 5th entry of the inode table 
holds information about a file, then the entry for the same file 
in the root must be the 5th entry. XFS interface stores files into 
the disk following this convention.

* There are 128 entries in the memory free list corresponding to 
each page of memory.
